# castplane web UI

The three.js web UI of the castplane TypeScript port (contract `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.4.10). Load a scene JSON,
look at it in 3D, drag the camera, and see the perspective shadow construction drawing that the ported core
(`ts/`) writes for that camera, laid exactly over the 3D view. It is static (no server, no network access at
runtime). The examples are bundled at build time.

```sh
npm ci                     # at the repository root (npm workspace: ts, web)
npm run -w ts build        # the core package "castplane" the UI imports
npm run -w web dev         # vite dev server
npm run -w web build       # tsc type check + vite build -> web/dist (static, base './')
npm run -w web preview     # serve web/dist locally
npm run -w web test        # orbit / download unit tests (node:test, web/test/)
```

## What it does

- **Loading**: the *Example* menu (the five `examples/*.json`, embedded by `import.meta.glob`), the file picker,
  or a file dropped anywhere on the page. A dropped file that is not JSON shows "not a JSON file". A scene
  that fails validation shows the `SceneError` field path and message in the error panel, and the previous
  scene stays loaded.
- **3D view** (`src/scene3d.ts`, `src/threeCamera.ts`): boxes, cylinders, cones, spheres and prisms placed with
  the core's `transform_frame`, light helpers (a sphere for a point light, an arrow for a directional light), and the
  ground plane with a grid. The three.js camera is built from the core's `camera_matrix` (no `lookAt` and no
  `fov`), so the WebGL image and the SVG overlay are two renderings of one castplane camera. Three.js casts no
  shadows (`renderer.shadowMap.enabled = false`). Every shadow you see comes from the core.
- **Camera** (`src/orbit.ts`):
  - left drag orbits (yaw / pitch, with pitch clamped to ±89.5°);
  - right drag or Shift + drag pans;
  - the wheel zooms (distance 0.05 … 1e4 m);
  - sliders set the focal length (logarithmic, 8–400 mm) and the roll (±180°);
  - *Reset camera* restores the scene's camera.
  
  Every frame builds an explicit target-form camera block from the lens fields of the scene camera.
- **Overlay** (`src/overlay.ts`): an `<svg>` over the canvas with the same CSS box and `viewBox`. On each
  animation frame where something changed, the frame runs `project_scene` → `compose` → `write_svg` (all six
  layers) against the cached stage A. Pointer events only update the state and at most one core render runs per
  frame (the latest camera wins). The layer checkboxes hide groups with CSS (`hide-<layer>` classes). The
  *3D view* checkbox hides the WebGL canvas.
- **Downloads** (`src/download.ts`):
  - *Download SVG*: `write_svg` with the checked layers, `<name>.svg`;
  - *Download JSON*: the spec §6.2 document, `<name>.json`;
  - *Download scene (current camera)*: the scene with the current camera block, `<name>.scene.json`. Run
    `castplane render <name>.scene.json -o out` to reproduce the picture with the Python reference: the
    smoke check below found the SVG byte-identical;
  - *Copy camera block*: copies the current camera block to the clipboard.
- **Panels**: the status line shows stage A ms (cached), `core ms` (B + C + SVG), `dom ms` (the overlay
  update), the overlay mode, and the point / edge / ray counts. The warnings table lists `code`, `ids` and
  `message` of the current document.

### Overlay modes during a drag

At rest the overlay is always the DOM (`innerHTML` of the writer's inner markup). During a drag, a scene whose
last resting SVG is longer than **250 000 characters** (`IMG_MODE_THRESHOLD`) is shown instead through
`<img src="blob:…">`. That image is the writer's unchanged SVG text for the checked layers. The blob URL is
revoked on the next frame, and the DOM overlay comes back on pointer-up (contract §5.4.11). The five examples
(8–11 k characters) always use the DOM mode. `benchmark_100.json` (1.96 M characters, ≈ 30 k elements) uses
the `<img>` mode during a drag.

## Measured `core ms` / `dom ms` (acceptance §5.4.13 (b))

The measurements come from `web/scripts/smoke.mjs`, a dev helper that runs Playwright + Chromium. They are
the drag frames of a 30-step mouse drag per scene. Each cell gives the minimum over the 30 frames, with the
median in brackets, for three runs. The setup was `vite build` + `vite preview` and headless Chromium
141.0.7390.37 (WebGL through SwiftShader) on the CI container. `performance.now()` in Chromium has 0.1 ms
resolution.

`core ms` is `project_scene + compose + write_svg` with stage A cached. `dom ms` is the synchronous overlay
update: `innerHTML` in DOM mode, or the blob and `img.src` in `<img>` mode. It does not include the browser's
later style, layout and paint, or the image decode.

| scene | SVG chars | drag mode | core ms run 1 | run 2 | run 3 | dom ms run 1 | run 2 | run 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| basic | 8 156 | DOM | 0.9 (1.2) | 0.9 (1.3) | 0.9 (1.3) | 0.5 (0.8) | 0.5 (0.8) | 0.5 (0.8) |
| construction_demo | 9 840 | DOM | 0.5 (0.7) | 0.6 (0.8) | 0.6 (1.0) | 0.7 (0.9) | 0.6 (0.9) | 0.6 (0.9) |
| curved_demo | 10 765 | DOM | 1.2 (1.8) | 1.4 (1.9) | 1.4 (1.8) | 0.6 (0.8) | 0.7 (0.9) | 0.7 (0.9) |
| directional | 11 118 | DOM | 1.3 (1.6) | 1.0 (1.5) | 1.3 (1.6) | 0.7 (0.8) | 0.8 (1.1) | 0.7 (1.1) |
| three_point | 9 847 | DOM | 0.5 (0.8) | 0.6 (0.7) | 0.6 (0.7) | 0.5 (0.8) | 0.5 (0.9) | 0.5 (0.7) |
| benchmark_100 | 1 961 491 | `<img>` | 57.0 (85.5) | 63.0 (85.6) | 59.2 (108.2) | 12.3 (15.5) | 11.5 (13.8) | 10.9 (14.8) |

For `benchmark_100.json` the resting frames (DOM mode, after load and after pointer-up) took 151 / 100, 98 / 105
and 111 / 129 ms of `innerHTML` in the three runs, plus the browser's layout of ≈ 30 k elements. This is why
the `<img>` mode exists. The in-browser `core ms` is close to the node benchmark's camera-only row (55–63 ms
minimum, `benchmarks/README.md`).

## Smoke check

```sh
npm run -w web build
(cd web && npx vite preview --port 4173 --strictPort) &
node web/scripts/smoke.mjs http://localhost:4173/ out/ docs/images/web_ui.png benchmarks/scenes/benchmark_100.json
```

The script needs a Playwright installed outside the repository; it is not a dependency. It checks that:

- the page loads the default example and renders the six overlay groups;
- for each example it writes the bundled core's scene-camera SVG and JSON to `out/`;
- a 30-step drag per scene runs, and it measures the table above;
- a page-wide drop loads a scene;
- the three downloads are saved;
- the error panel appears for a non-JSON file and for an invalid scene.

Last run:

- the bundled core in Chromium wrote SVG byte-identical to the Python writer for all five examples, and its
  JSON passes the conformance comparator;
- the downloaded `<name>.scene.json`, rendered with the Python CLI, gives the downloaded SVG byte for byte.
